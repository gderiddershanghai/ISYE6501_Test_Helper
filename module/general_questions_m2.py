Question A1: \nThe airport's chief strategist proposes the following approach: GIVEN the historical data of flights and passenger numbers, USE a certain statistical method TO impute the missing passenger data. Then, GIVEN the complete dataset, USE a forecasting model TO predict the number of flights and passengers for the next decade. Lastly, GIVEN these forecasts, USE a planning algorithm TO determine the minimum number of additional gates needed to handle the peak passenger traffic with a certain efficiency level.

A hospital emergency department (ED) has created a stochastic discrete-event simulation model of the ED,
including patient arrivals, resource usage (rooms, doctors, etc.), and treatment duration.

EDs are not first-come-first-served; a patient who arrives with a more-serious condition will be treated
first, ahead of even long-waiting patients with less-serious conditions.

When a patient comes in, the ED will run the simulation to quickly give the patient an estimate of the
expected wait time before being treated.

How many times does the ED need to run the simulation for each new patient (i.e., how many replications
are needed)?\n

Question A1\n

A supermarket is analyzing its checkout lines, to determine how many checkout lines to have open at each time.

At busy times (about 10 percent of the times), the arrival rate is 5 shoppers/minute. At other times, the arrival rate is 2 shoppers/minute.
Once a shopper starts checking out (at any time), it takes an average of 3 minutes to complete the checkout.

[NOTE: This is a simplified version of the checkout system. If you have deeper knowledge of how supermarket checkout systems work,
please do not use it for this question; you would end up making the question more complex than it is designed to be.]
\n
a. The first model the supermarket tries is a queuing model with 20 lines open at all times. What would you expect the queuing model to show?
- Wait times are low at both busy and non-busy times.\n
- Wait times are low at busy times and high at non-busy times.\n
- Wait times are low at non-busy times and high at busy times.\n
- Wait times are high at both busy and non-busy times.\n
\n
b. The second model the supermarket tries is a queuing model with 10 lines open during busy times and 4 lines open during non-busy times. What would you expect the queuing model to show?
- Wait times are low at both busy and non-busy times.\n
- Wait times are low at busy times and high at non-busy times.\n
- Wait times are low at non-busy times and high at busy times.\n
- Wait times are high at both busy and non-busy times.\n
\n
The supermarket now has decided that, when there are 5 people waiting (across all lines), the supermarket will open an express checkout line,
which stays open until nobody is left waiting.

The supermarket would like to model this new process with a Markov chain, where each state is the number of people waiting
(e.g., 0 people waiting, 1 person waiting, etc.).

Notice that now, the transition probabilities from a state like "3 people waiting" depend on how many lines are currently open,
and therefore depend on whether the system was more recently in the state "5 people waiting" or "0 people waiting".

c. Which of the following statements about the process (the checkout system) and its relation to the Markov chain's memoryless property
(previous states don't affect the probability of moving from one state to another) is true?
- The process is memoryless, so the Markov chain is an appropriate model.\n
- The process is memoryless and the Markov chain is an appropriate model only if the arrivals follow the Poisson distribution and
  the checkout times follow the Exponential distribution.\n
- The process is not memoryless, so the Markov chain model would not be not well-defined.\n
